      data. Under no circumstances are special categories of personal data
      processed within the meaning of Article 9 of the GDPR.
    </p>

    <h3>Legal basis for the processing of personal data</h3>
    <p>
      The legal basis for the processing of personal data is consent. Lucas P.
      Basso commits to obtaining the express and verifiable consent of the User

      purposes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The User will have the right to withdraw their consent at any time.
      Withdrawing consent will be as easy as giving it. As a general rule, the
      withdrawal of consent will not condition the use of the Website.
    </p>
    <p>
      In cases where the User must or may provide their data through forms to
      make inquiries, request information, or for reasons related to the content
      of the Website, it will be indicated whether the completion of any of them
      is mandatory because they
    </p>

    <p>
      are essential for the proper development of the operation carried out.
    </p>

    <h3>Purposes of personal data processing</h3>
    <p>
      Personal data is collected and managed by Lucas P. Basso for the purpose
      of facilitating, expediting, and fulfilling the commitments established
      between the Website and the User or maintaining the relationship
      established in the forms filled out by the latter or to address a request
      or inquiry.
    </p>
    <p>
      Additionally, the data may be used for commercial purposes of
      personalization, operation, statistics, and activities related to Lucas P.
      Basso's corporate purpose, as well as for data extraction, storage, and
      marketing studies to tailor the Content offered to the User and improve
      the quality, functionality, and navigation of the Website.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the time the personal data is obtained, the User will be informed of
      the specific purposes of the processing of the personal data; that is, the
      use or uses that will be made of the collected information.
    </p>

    <h3>Retention periods for personal data</h3>
    <p>
      Personal data will only be retained for the minimum time necessary for the
      purposes of their processing and, in any case, only for the following
      period: 12 months, or until the User requests their deletion.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the time the personal data is obtained, the User will be informed of
      the period during which the personal data will be retained or, when this
      is not possible, of the criteria used to determine this period.
    </p>

    <h3>Recipients of personal data</h3>
    <p>
      The User's personal data will be shared with the following recipients or
      categories of recipients:
    </p>
    <p>
      Google Analytics:
      https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/protocol/v1/reference?hl=es,
      YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/, Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/,
      Spotify: https://open.spotify.com, Facebook: https://www.facebook.com,
      TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/es/
    </p>
    <p>
      If the Data Controller intends to transfer personal data to a third
      country or international organization, at the time the personal data is
      obtained, the User will be informed about the third country or
      international organization to which the data is intended to be
      transferred, as well as the existence or absence of a Commission adequacy
      decision.
    </p>

    <h3>Personal data of minors</h3>
    <p>
      Respecting the provisions of Articles 8 of the GDPR and 7 of Organic Law
      3/2018, of December 5, on the Protection of Personal Data and the
      guarantee of digital rights, only individuals over 14 years of age may
      give lawful consent for the processing of their personal data by Lucas P.
      Basso. If the individual is under 14 years of age, parental or guardian
      consent will be required for processing, and it will only be considered
      lawful to the extent that they have authorized it.
    </p>

    <h3>Secrecy and security of personal data</h3>
    <p>
      Gran Savant commits to adopting the necessary technical and organizational
      measures, according to the appropriate level of security for the data
      collected, to ensure the security of personal data and to prevent the
      destruction, loss, or accidental or unlawful alteration of personal data
      transmitted, stored, or otherwise processed, or unauthorized access to
      such data.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Website has an SSL certificate (Secure Socket Layer), which ensures
      that personal data is transmitted securely and confidentially, as the
      transmission of data between the server and the User, and in feedback, is
      fully encrypted.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, since Lucas P. Basso cannot guarantee the invulnerability of the
      internet or the complete absence of hackers or others who fraudulently
      access personal data, the Data Controller commits to promptly notify the
      User when a security breach of personal data occurs that is likely to
      result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of individuals. In
      accordance with Article 4 of the GDPR, a breach of the security of
      personal data is understood to be any breach of security that causes the
      accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, or alteration of personal data
      transmitted, stored, or otherwise processed, or unauthorized access to
      such data.
    </p>
    <p>
      Personal data will be treated as confidential by the Data Controller, who
      commits to informing and ensuring, through a legal or contractual
      obligation, that this confidentiality is respected by its employees,
      associates, and any person to whom it makes the information available.
    </p>

    <h3>Rights arising from the processing of personal data</h3>
    <p>
      The User has the following rights recognized in the GDPR and Organic Law
      3/2018, of December 5, on the Protection of Personal Data and the
      guarantee of digital rights:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Right of access: The User has the right to obtain confirmation of
        whether Lucas P. Basso is processing their personal data and, if so, to
        obtain information about their specific personal data and the processing
        carried out by Lucas P. Basso, as well as, among other things,
        information available on the origin of such data and the recipients of
        the communications made or planned for such data.
      </li>
      <li>
        Right of rectification: The User has the right to have their personal
        data
      </li>

      <li>
        Right of rectification: The User has the right to have their personal
        data modified if it is inaccurate or incomplete, taking into account the
        purposes of the processing.
      </li>
      <li>
        Right to erasure ("the right to be forgotten"): The User has the right,
        as long as current legislation does not establish otherwise, to obtain
        the erasure of their personal data when it is no longer necessary for
        the purposes for which it was collected or processed; when the User has
        withdrawn their consent for processing and there is no other legal basis
        for it; when the User objects to processing and there is no other
        legitimate reason for it to continue; when personal data has been
        processed unlawfully; when personal data must be erased to comply with a
        legal obligation; or when personal data has been obtained as a result of
        a direct offer of information society services to a child under 14 years
        of age. In addition to erasing the data, the Data Controller, taking
        into account the available technology and the cost of its
        implementation, shall take reasonable steps to inform the data
        controllers processing the personal data of the data subject's request
        for erasure of any links to that personal data.
      </li>
      <li>
        Right to restrict processing: The User has the right to limit the
        processing of their personal data. The User has the right to obtain the
        restriction of processing when they dispute the accuracy of their
        personal data; when processing is unlawful; when the Data Controller no
        longer needs the personal data, but the User needs it to file claims;
        and when the User has objected to processing.
      </li>
      <li>
        Right to data portability: If processing is carried out by automated
        means, the User has the right to receive their personal data from the
        Data Controller in a structured, commonly used, and machine-readable
        format, and to transmit it to another data controller. Where technically
        feasible, the Data Controller will transmit the data directly to that
        other controller.
      </li>
      <li>
        Right to object: The User has the right to object to the processing of
        their personal data or to cease the processing of their data by Lucas P.
        Basso.
      </li>
      <li>
        Right not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated
        processing, including profiling: The User has the right not to be
        subject to an individualized decision based solely on automated
        processing of their personal data, including profiling, unless current
        legislation provides otherwise.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Therefore, the User may exercise their rights by sending a written
      communication to the Data Controller with the reference
      "GDPR-www.lucaspbasso.com," specifying:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Name and surname of the User and a copy of their ID. In cases where
        representation is admitted, the identification of the person
        representing the User by the same means will also be necessary, as well
        as the document accrediting the representation. The photocopy of the ID
        may be replaced by any other valid legal means of proving identity.
      </li>
      <li>
        Request with the specific reasons for the request or information to
        which the User wants access.
      </li>
      <li>Address for notification purposes.</li>
      <li>Date and signature of the applicant.</li>
      <li>Any document proving the request made.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This request and any other accompanying documents can be sent to the
      following address and/or email:

    <p>Postal Address: C/ Monsalupe 11 bajo B Madrid</p>

    <h3>Links to third-party websites</h3>
    <p>
      The Website may include hyperlinks or links that allow access to
      third-party websites other than Lucas P. Basso and therefore not operated
      by Lucas P. Basso. The owners of these websites will have their own data
      protection policies, and they will be responsible for their own files and
      privacy practices.
    </p>

    <h3>Complaints to the supervisory authority</h3>
    <p>
      If the User believes that there is a problem or violation of current
      regulations in the way their personal data is being processed, they will
      have the right to effective judicial protection and to file a complaint
      with a supervisory authority, in particular, in the State where they have
      their habitual residence, place of work, or the alleged infringement. In
      the case of Spain, the supervisory authority is the Spanish Data
      Protection Agency (https://www.aepd.es/).
    </p>

    <h2>II. ACCEPTANCE AND CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY</h2>
    <p>
      It is necessary for the User to have read and agree to the conditions on
      the protection of personal data contained in this Privacy Policy, as well
      as to accept the processing of their personal data for the Data Controller
      to proceed with it in the manner, during the periods, and for the purposes
      indicated. The use of the Website implies acceptance of its Privacy
      Policy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucas P. Basso reserves the right to modify its Privacy Policy according
      to its own criteria or motivated by a change in legislation,
      jurisprudence, or doctrine of the Spanish Data Protection Agency. Changes
      or updates to this Privacy Policy will not
